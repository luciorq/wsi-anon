## Description of requirement

What? Why? Who are the stakeholders?

For bugs: Which version/runtime environment? Steps To Reproduce? Screenshots, Logfiles.

*Example: Algorithm developer X plans to use fluorescence imaging for their example algorithm, which we currently do not support. Add support to obtain WSI-patches and metadata from the WSI-Service*

## Acceptance criteria

What must be fulfilled in order for the implementation of the requirement/user story/bug elimination to be accepted?

*Example:*
- *AC: fluorescence images can be loaded*
- *AC: user can specify one or multiple channels when requesting image data*
- *AC: image compression is compatible with fluoresence files*
